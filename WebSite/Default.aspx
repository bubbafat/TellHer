    The (<em>sort of</em>) short story ...
</p>
<p>
    I&#39;m one of those guys that loves me wife but is pretty bad at showing it - and 
    probably even worse at saying it.&nbsp; I just assume she knows.&nbsp; We&#39;re 
    married, right?&nbsp; That means I love her.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Turns out, that&#39;s not how she views the world.&nbsp; Mars, Venus and all that.</p>
<p>
    When I want to be better at something there is a process I follow.&nbsp; I make 
    lists.&nbsp; I practice.&nbsp; I set goals.&nbsp; I work on it a little every 
    day.&nbsp; Eventually it becomes second nature - or at least something I&#39;m 
    better at.&nbsp; That&#39;s what led me here.</p>
<p>
    I wanted to be better at being a husband.</p>
<p>
    So I made a list - lots and lots of little things I need to remember to do.&nbsp; 
    Everything from saying &quot;I love you&quot; to being more affectionate in public to 
    remembering important dates.&nbsp; Then I created a little service that sends me 
    a text message every morning with a simple message to practice being awesome.&nbsp; 
    Sometimes it is a specific action I need to take that day and sometimes it is 
    something less specific or immediate.</p>
<p>
    The pay off?&nbsp; She noticed.&nbsp; She asks &quot;What&#39;s today&#39;s message?&quot;&nbsp; 
    She cares about this - and that means I care about this.</p>
<p class="style1">
    <strong><span class="style2">Interested in getting these messages?&nbsp; It&#39;s simple.&nbsp;</span></strong><span 
        class="style2"></p>
    <p class="style1">
        </span><strong><span class="style2">Just send 
    a text message with the word &quot;join&quot; to 919-261-3536</span></strong></p>
<p>
    That&#39;s it.&nbsp; You&#39;ll get a confirmation text with instructions on how to quit 
    (just text &quot;quit&quot;!) and then once a day (including today) you&#39;ll get one of my 
    messages.</p>
    <p>
        Oh - we&#39;re in limited beta but feel free to spread the word and send me feedback 
        on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/TellHerNow">@tellhernow</a>)</p>
